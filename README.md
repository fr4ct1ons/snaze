# snaze
Repository for a college project, for the implementation of a snake game with a twist - The snake is trapped in a maze!  

Subject: Programming Language I  
Student: Gabriel Paes Landim de Lucena  
Teacher: Selan Rodrigues dos Santos  

## About
For this project, we had to implement the snake game, a score counting system and an AI for the snake. For this program, the AI simply walks around and chooses a random direction once it reaches a place with multiple possibilities.  
The game stops once either the snake scores 5 points or when it hits a wall.  

## Instalation
Once you are on the project directory on the terminal, you can simply type "make" in the terminal. Once the program finishes installing you can just use it with the command `./snaze <inputfile>`. A test file named "input.dat" is provided.  

## Errors
There is a definition of the snaze object destructor, but for some reason, it causes the program to crash. I've left it commented so that it doesn't crash. Feel free to uncomment it if you want, but you were warned.
